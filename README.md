# Optimization Techniques

This is the second project of the "Optimization Techniques" course for the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 7th semester, AUTh, 2023.

# Project-B

Minimization of a given convex function without restrictions using the following algorithms:

- Steepest Descent

- Newton

- Levenberg-Marquardt

# Project-C

Minimization of a given convex function with restrictions using Steepest Descent with Projection method.

# Final Project

Implementing a genetic algorithm to yield an approximation of a function as a sum of Gaussian functions.
